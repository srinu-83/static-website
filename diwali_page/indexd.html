    <p>Diwali, one of the major religious festivals in Hinduism, Jainism, 
        and Sikhism, lasting for five days from the 13th day of the dark half 
        of the lunar month Ashvina to the second day of the light half of
         the lunar month Karttika. (The corresponding dates in the Gregorian calendar usually fall in late October and November.)
          The name is derived from the Sanskrit term dipavali, meaning ‚Äúrow of lights.‚Äù 
          The festival generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness.
Observances of Diwali differ depending on region and tradition.
 Among Hindus the most widespread custom is the lighting of diyas (small earthenware lamps filled with oil) 
 on the night of the new moon to invite the presence of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. In Bengal the goddess
  Kali is worshipped. In North India the festival also celebrates the royal
   homecoming of Rama (along with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman) to the city of Ayodhya
    after defeating Ravana, the 10-headed king of the demons, thus connecting the
     festival with the holiday of Dussehra. In South India the festival marks Krishna‚Äôs defeat of the demon Narakasura.
      Some celebrate Diwali as a commemoration of the marriage of Lakshmi and Vishnu, 
      while others observe it as the birthday of Lakshmi.</p>
